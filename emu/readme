 Description

     petcat converts input files from the most	common	CBM  file
     formats  into  printable  ASCII  form and writes to standard
     output. The type of input file is determined  automatically,
     if	possible, and appropriate conversion is	performed.  Since
     a few of the  BASIC  versions  have  keywords  defined  dif-
     ferently,	the  right  conversion	has to be selected on the
     command line.  Where such confusion cannot	happen,	automati-
     cal  recognition  of  input  is  used.  This  is useful when
     expanding several files at	once or	if the	program	 contains
     code   for	 several  versions,  selected  according  to  the
     hardware; eg. Simon's Basic vs. Basic 7.0.
